# Shepherd's Pie

Based on [Babish's recipe](https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/shepherdspie).

## Mashed Potatoes ("crust")
### Ingredients
- 3 lbs. Yukon Gold potatoes
- 2 oz. aged white cheddar, shredded (Babish suggests 3-4 oz)
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup chives, chopped
- Kosher salt
- Pepper, fresh crushed
	- White pepper results in no black specks, but is optional
- 1/2 cup milk
	- Ideally, higher fat content (I've used half&half and it turned out great, whole milk is nearly the same though)
- 2 egg yolks

### Preparation
1. Peel the potatoes, cut them in half, and place them in your pot of salted cold water.
2. Let boil until ready (Babish says 20 mins past the point of boiling).
	- A paring knife should easily cut into the potatoes
3. Drain the pot of potatoes, set the heat to low-medium, and replace the potatoes.
4. Add the butter and chives to the potatoes and mash until not very lumpy (using preferred method).
	- (if you want to add a little bit of cheese here, be my guest)
	- Masher: mash
	- Ricer: continually rice, occasionally cleaning the top off
	- Electric hand mixer: 30-40% speed
5. Add egg yolks and milk, continue mashing until smooth and creamy.
6. Salt & pepper to taste.

## Stew ("fillings")
### Ingredients
- 1 lbs. ground lamb (if you substitute for beef, it's a cottage pie)
- 0.5 white onion, chopped
- 4 carrots, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp. rosemary (optional, honestly I can't get it...)
- 1 tbsp. thyme (if ya got it)
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped or crushed
- 1-1 1/2 tbsp. flour (more = thicker stew)
- 1 cup bone broth (I can only get beef broth - it works)
- 1 cup Guinness
	- Babish says "Dark Irish Stout" but we know what he really means
	- Honestly, I've used corona and it still tasted great. Do _not_ recommend mango beer.
	- Ales result in the stew being a little "lighter" (not soupy, but less viscuous *and* lighter in color)
- Some green peas
	- if canned, 1 can does fine
	- if frozen, 1/2 bag is about it
	- if fresh, idk try and replicate one of those amounts?
- Worcestershire sauce
- Tomato paste

**note**: Babish suggests 1 tbsp Madeira, I haven't tried that though
**note**: Babish suggests 1 puck Demi-Glace, which I have tried but you have to make it ahead of time (recipe [here](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/bone-broth))

### Preparation
1. Chop everything, if you haven't. If you're crushing the garlic, this can be done immediately into the pan.
2. On a lightly oiled pan, cook the meat on medium-high until brown. Drain fat if necessary so you have no more than 3 tbsp on the pan.
	- I do it just like a steak and then break up the meat, but I've heard there are other preferred methods
3. Add onions. If you'd like soft carrots, add them now as well, otherwise let the onions cook for 2-3 minutes, add the carrots, and let cook for 2-3 more minutes.
	- The onions should be translucent around the edges after 2-3 minutes
4. Make a hole in the center, add the garlic and circle it with tomato paste.
5. Mix and stir for 2-3 minutes. Add the rosemary and thyme (if you got it)
6. Add the flour and continue to mix until there is a thick fond on the bottom of the pan.
7. Deglaze with beer and broth, ensuring that all of the fond is scraped up. Add a few dashes of Worcestershire.
	- Optionally add Madeira
	- Optionally add Demi-Glace
8. Cook the peas.

## Pie
1. Pre-heat oven to 350F
2. Put the stew in the pie dish.
3. Put the peas over the stew.
4. Put the mashed potatoes over the peas.
5. Even out the mashed potatoes, then use a fork to "scratch" the top of the potatoes.
6. Put the dish in the oven for 15 mins
7. Cover the top in the 2 oz of shredded cheese
8. Cover for 10 more mins
9. (Optional) Babish says to broil for the last 2-3 mins, but I haven't tried this.
