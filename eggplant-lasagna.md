Recipe adapted from [@depombo](https://github.com/depombo).

## The 'Plant
### Ingredients
- 2 Eggplants
- Salt
- Pepper
- Olive Oil

### Preparation
1. Lightly coat a baking tray with olive oil.
2. Cut your eggplants up into 1/4"-1/2" slices and place them in a single layer onto the baking tray. Don't overlap them. Might have to do a few rounds, but trust me it's worth it.
3. Bake in the oven at 400F (205C) for 15-25 minutes, until soft, perspirating, and slightly brown/black.
4. Once out, dab the perspiration with a paper towl.

## The Sauce
### Ingredients
- 2lbs ground meat - beef, bison, or lamb (beef is best, but you do you fam)
	- I guess pork or chicken work? Not sure though
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp. rosemary
- 1 tbsp. Italian seasoning
- 2 cups Marinara or Tomato-Basil sauce
- 1 cup broth - try and match your meat, or else do vegetable
- Salt
- Pepper

### Preparation
1. Put the olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat and let it shimmer.
2. Put your meat in the pan.
3. Once your meat is browned on the bottom, flip it and let it cook some more.
4. Once the meat is well browned on both sides, mash it up using a wooden spoon and add the garlic, rosemary, seasoning, and broth. Cover and let reduce for 10 minutes.
5. Once the broth is well-reduced, add your tomato sauce, stir, and let sit until well-reduced.
6. Salt and pepper to taste.

### Ingredients
- 8 oz of Ricotta cheese, crumbled
